                        <strong>Greenwich</strong>, a historic town in southeast Greater London, is famed for its maritime heritage and as the site of the Prime Meridian and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Located south of the River Thames, 8.9 km from Charing Cross, it is home to the Royal Observatory, established in 1675 by King Charles II. Though no longer used for astronomical research since 1998, the observatory remains significant as the location of prime Meridian, marker of longitude zero, officially designated at the 1884 International Meridian Conference.

            <h2>Artwork Analysis and Historical Background</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Turner</strong> presents a sweeping panorama of Greater London as seen from Greenwich Park, overlooking Sir Christopher Wren’s Naval Hospital, the River Thames, and the distant city. Scattered across the foreground are maps and globes, with a retired navy officer, wearing glasses and leaning on a cane, examining two design plans—an allusion to Britain’s storied past. Slightly further back, a man in a fashionable top hat and yellow gloves raises his hands in celebration of a thriving present. Finally, at the base of the hill, a third figure peers through a telescope, observing the competition between steamships and sailing vessels on the river—a subtle nod to the future. This watercolor is part of a series Turner created around 1825, conceived as preliminary works for an ambitious but ultimately unpublished set of engravings.

                <strong>By 1825</strong>, <strong>small handheld telescopes</strong>, such as monocular or binocular models, had become widespread. They were primarily used for navigation, military purposes, and terrestrial observation.

                        <strong>Joseph Mallord William Turner RA </strong>(April 23, 1775 – December 19, 1851), known during his lifetime as William Turner, was one of the most representative landscape painters of the Romantic era in Britain. Renowned for his innovative use of color and mastery of light and shadow, he earned the title "Painter of Light." His works had a profound influence on later Impressionist and modern art movements.

            <h2>Style Interpretation</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Romanticism</strong> responded to the anxiety of industrilization by calling for a return to nature and a reverence for tradition. Romantic artists focused on using light, shadow, and color to create emotional atmospheres, with natural landscapes being imbued with symbolic meaning. While Romanticism inherently critiqued industrialization and urbanization, Turner’s works reflect his complex attitude toward these changes. He often juxtaposed nature with human civilization, particularly technological progress. This contrast not only represented humanity’s conquest of nature but also reflected the inner turmoil industrialization caused in Romantic artists.
